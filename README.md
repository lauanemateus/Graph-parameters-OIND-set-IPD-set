# Graph-parameters-Lexicographic-Product
Find minimum cardinality of a IPD-set, i.e, the minimun cardinality of a open-independent and open-dominating set;  find minimum cardinality of a Yoind-set, i.e, the minimun cardinality of a dominating and open-independent set in Graphs (also in Lexicographic Product)

* To compile one of these codes: read_multiple_matrices.cpp, code_adj_matrix.cpp, code_adj_list.cpp is just to write in the terminal like is showed below:

code_name.cpp funcions.cpp -o new_name

* Then you can execute the file new_name in the terminal like showed above:

./new_name
