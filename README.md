# Graph-parameters-Lexicographic-Product

This repository contains code developed to support my research on graphs, specifically in the analysis of Open Independent Dominating Sets (OIND).

The algorithms were implemented using the backtracking technique. This code is a crucial tool for validating hypotheses and experiments in my research, enabling advancements in graph theory and the understanding of OIND sets.

The purpuse of the code is basically:
* Find minimum cardinality of a IPD-set, i.e, the minimun cardinality of a open-independent and open-dominating set;
* Find minimum cardinality of a OIND-set, i.e, the minimun cardinality of a dominating and open-independent set in Graphs (also in Lexicographic Product).

See more about those concepts in the following papers: "Open-independent, open-locating-dominating sets" from Suk J. Seo, Peter J. Slater and "Induced-Paired Dominating Sets in Lexicographic Product of Graphs" from Erika M. M. Coelho, Isabela Carolina L. Frota.

* To compile one of these codes: read_multiple_matrices.cpp, code_adj_matrix.cpp, code_adj_list.cpp is just to write in the terminal like is showed below:

code_name.cpp funcions.cpp -o new_name

* Then you can execute the file new_name in the terminal like showed above:

./new_name
