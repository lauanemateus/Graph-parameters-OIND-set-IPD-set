# Graph-parameters-Lexicographic-Product

This code was developed to help me in my research, so I can do tests in a lot of graphs to find the minimum cardinality of the OIND-set.

The purpuse of the code is basically 
* Find minimum cardinality of a IPD-set, i.e, the minimun cardinality of a open-independent and open-dominating set;
* Find minimum cardinality of a OIND-set, i.e, the minimun cardinality of a dominating and open-independent set in Graphs (also in Lexicographic Product).

See more about those concepts in the following papers: "Open-independent, open-locating-dominating sets" from Suk J. Seo, Peter J. Slater and "Induced-Paired Dominating Sets in Lexicographic Product of Graphs" from Erika M. M. Coelho, Isabela Carolina L. Frota.

* To compile one of these codes: read_multiple_matrices.cpp, code_adj_matrix.cpp, code_adj_list.cpp is just to write in the terminal like is showed below:

code_name.cpp funcions.cpp -o new_name

* Then you can execute the file new_name in the terminal like showed above:

./new_name
